My name is Luiz Fernando (aka Russo) and I'm a **Computer Science** undergraduate student at the **University of SÃ£o Paulo** (Brazil), having previously studied **Physics** at the same university from 2018 to 2020 and changed degrees after discovering CS was my true vocation.

My interests range from Computational Physics (specially statistical and fluid mechanics) to Statistical Learning Theory and Machine Learning in general.

I am currently working on the project **Flood Image Classification Using Deep Learning** as an undergraduate researcher, part of the *IBM-FAPESP Center of Research on Engineering*.
